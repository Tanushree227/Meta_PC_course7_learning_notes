      <p className="text-justify">
        User experience (UX) design is the process design teams use to create
        products that provide meaningful and relevant experiences to users.
        <br />
        UX design involves the design of the entire process of acquiring and
        integrating the product, including aspects of branding, design,
        usability and function.

      <span className="font-semibold text-lg">UX Design is User-Centered</span>
      <p className="text-justify">
        Since UX design encompasses the entire user journey, it’s a
        multidisciplinary field–UX designers come from various backgrounds, such
        as visual design, programming, psychology and interaction design. To
        design for human users also means working with a heightened scope
        regarding accessibility and accommodating many potential users’ physical
        limitations, such as reading small text.

        A UX designers typical tasks vary but often include user research,
        creating personas, designing wireframes and interactive prototypes, and
        testing designs. These tasks can vary significantly from one
        organization to the next. Still, they always demand designers to be the
        users advocates and keep their needs at the center of all design and
        development efforts. Thats also why most UX designers work in some form
        of user-centered work process and keep channeling their best-informed
        efforts until they optimally address all of the relevant issues and user
        needs.
