          UI/UX plays a vital role for websites or any other digital product as
          it directly impacts user interaction and engagement. UI and UX are two
          different but interrelated concepts in the design of a web page or a
          digital product. In simple words, UI is like a visible part of a
          product and UX is the concept behind it.

          UI/UX design is often undermined by the impact it creates on a website
          or an application. companies and startups realize it late how crucial
          UI/UX design is in the making of any digital product, website, or
          application. UI/UX is often misunderstood as making a design file that
          has the blueprint of the entire website or application. But in truth,
          UI/UX design is way more than that. It even includes research,
          presenting data for business strategy, wireframes, prototypes,
          customer feedback, graphic design, animations, and a lot more.
